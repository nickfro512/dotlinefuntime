Dot Line Fun Time - simple game for Android

This is the source code from a game I built for an Android development class project final. The Oval and Rectangle classes etc. were established in an earlier homework assignment and I built the rest on top of that. The entire Android project is a massive directory so decided to just provide source here, if there's any demand for the APK or project files contact me and I'll upload.
